The game <War in 8> (with its version <War in 4>) is a rational game
for all ages. It demands attention and the spirit of observation,
favors the combinatorial analysis of the variants and develops the
habit of carrying things to the end. A similar game - but simpler -
that facilitates learning and practicing the game <War in 8> is
<Dogs and fox>. The game offers amateurs a wide field of study and
analysis - not too simple - being perfectly adapted for composing and
solving problems, as well as for correspondence.

Two people take part in the game, each of whom aimed to get the
opposing <armed> fight out. The game can end with the victory of one
of the players, or undecided - the draw. Practicing the game requires
a game board of 8x8 squares (chessboard) and 8 pieces (pawns) for 
each player - pieces that will be different colors. Let's name the two
players: A and B, and the pieces - respectively their colors: white
and black.

The pieces can only be moved diagonally, the goal being to surround
the enemy piece to remove it from the board. (img 1&2)
The one who manages to get more soldiers out of the battle wins the game
opponents, so the one who stays with more pieces on the board.
